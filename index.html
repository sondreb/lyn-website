            <h2>Introducing Lyn</h2>
            <p><img class="drawing-right" src="assets/undraw_Hello_re_3evm.svg">Lyn is an open source development
                project working to implement the Basis of Lightning Technology (BOLT),
                which is the standardized technical specification for the implementation of the Lightning Network.</p>
            <p>
                We're building Lyn to enable Lightning-protocol applications and services ontop of Bitcoin and Stratis
                blockchains, making Stratis even better for real world financial services and businesses.
            </p>
            <p>
                The team behind Lyn is an extremely experienced team of software developers and engineers that already
                have many years of experience working on Blockchain technologies.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are other existing implementations of Lightning, but none that is based upon C# and .NET. We
                believe that an alternative implementation based on .NET, will increase innovation and adoptions among
                more developers globally.

            <h2>A Stratis Decentralized Accelerator proposal</h2>
            <h3>Lightning node in C#</h3>
            <p><img class="drawing-right" src="assets/undraw_Development_re_g5hq.svg">
                We make a bid to the Stratis Decentralized Accelerator for funding to develop a lightning node in C#,
                this will be deployed on top of the Stratis network but will also be a scaling solution for the Stratis
                technology stack.
                Our focus will be a solution that is cloud aware (mainly the Azure cloud), multi chain and with support
                for
                multi users in mind.
            </p>
            <p>
                C# is the 5th most used language and is very popular with enterprise and corporate environments,
                currently C# solutions that want to interact with the lightning network will need use bindings to
                external dlls and/or write extensions in unfamiliar languages, having a lightning implementation in C#
                using industry common practices will allow developers to easy extend lightning and the usage of native
                packages to interact with the lightning network.

            <h2>What is lightning?</h2>
            <p><img class="drawing-right" src="assets/undraw_nakamoto_2iv6.svg">Lightning is a layer two scaling
                protocol that is sits on top of the Bitcoin network, the lightning
                protocol is designed with multichain support in mind and can be used to scale other blockchains such as
                the Stratis network.
                On the lightning network participants open bidirectional payment channels between them and can then send
                bitcoin payments off chain, but nodes can also advertise their channels on the lightning gossip network
                and respond to payment routing requests for a competitive fee.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lightning is designed with the ability to add many new message types, lightning is also
                designed with privacy in mind such that all communications between peers are private and encrypted,
                payment routing uses onion like layers to hide recipients identity and protect privacy (when routing a
                payment a node does not know who initiated the payment and who it is for)</p>
            <h3>Applications of lightning</h3>
            <p>
                Anything that uses payments (and micro payments) can integrate lightning such as:

            <ul>
                <li>messaging apps (Sphinx)</li>
                <li>social media networks</li>
                <li>games (unity)</li>
                <li>instant deposit to exchanges</li>
                <li>smart contact protocol like RGB are being developed on top of lightning</li>
                <li>submarine swaps (offchain to onchain transactions)</li>
                <li>cross chain onchain swaps (using submarine swaps from a Bitcoin lightning channel to a Stratis
                    mainchain address)</li>
                <li>cross chain off chain swaps (cross chain lightning to lightning swaps offer complete privacy)</li>
                <li>liquidity markets</li>
                <li>micropayments</li>
                <li>static invoices (bolt12)</li>
            </ul>

            And we believe lots more features will come up over time.
            </p>

            <h3>Lightning projected growth</h3>
            <p>
                The lightning network capacity now exceeded $100m (2300 Bitcoin) with over 25k nodes
                and over 65k channels, in the last month alone the network capacity increased by 20%.
                Lightning network is constantly growing.

            <h2>Technical proposal</h2>

            <p>
                Our proposal comes in two parts a full <strong>lightning node</strong> implementation based on the
                lightning RFC also
                referred to as BOLTs (Basis of Lightning Technology),
                an implementation which is compatible with the Bitcoin network and the Stratis network (a multi-chain
                lightning node).
                The second part is about the <strong>applications of lightning</strong> that use the lightning node
                implementation such as swaps, watchtowers
                and routing services which will be targeting cloud provides or the Stratis master nodes.
            </p>

            <h3>Lightning Node</h2>
                <p>
                    The following sections describe the BOLTs we will implement that are required to run a lightning
                    node.
                    It also includes a docker based test suite to test and insure compatibility between the existing
                    implementation.
                    The node will be compatible with the popular UI for lightning called RTL (Ride The Lightning)
                </p>

                <p>
                    All the BOLT codebase will come in the form of nuget packages, this are lightning library components
                    that can be used in C# applications such as web, mobile and even games (with unity).
                </p>

                <p>
                    Work has already started on an implementation called Lyn (lightning in Danish).
                    The codebase can be found here <a href="https://github.com/block-core/lyn">Lyn</a>
                </p>

                <p>
                    The lightning node adds scaling capabilities to the already wide Stratis technology stack, we will
                    develop
                    the node with cloud architecture in mind, parts of the workload required to successfully route
                    payments in lighting
                    can be delegated to dedicated cloud service providers or master nodes.
                </p>

                <strong>Payment Channels (BOLT1,2,3,5,8,9)</strong>
                <p>
                    Payment channels allow the exchange of transactions between two participants which are sending
                    payments
                    off-chain in a trustless setup.
                    This include a node that can create funding transactions to open channels, the commitment
                    transaction
                    to secure the funds and the HTLCs (hash timed locked outputs) to make off chain payments between
                    participants.
                    It also includes lots of boilerplate components such as the gossip messages, noise protocol the
                    interaction with base layer etc..
                </p>
                <p>
                    A big part of this section is already implemented (BOLT1,3,8,9) in the Lyn repo.
                </p>

                <strong>Payment Routing (BOLT4,11)</strong>
                <p>
                    Onion routing (built of layers like an onion) refer to the ability to route payments between
                    participants who don't share a channel directly,
                    an onion routed packet is used to route a payment from an origin node to a final node through a
                    number of intermediate nodes, called hops.
                    The payment initiator node, who knows the public keys of each intermediate, create the onion packet
                    in such a way that each node only knows
                    it's previous and next route but can't read information of any participant or how many hope this
                    route has.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Invoicing, defining protocol messages where participants can request payments over Lightning.
                </p>

                <strong>Payment Channel Discovery (BOLT7,10)</strong>
                <p>
                    Node and channel discovery serve two different purposes, Node discovery allows nodes to broadcast
                    information about themselves, so that other
                    nodes can open connections and establish payment channels with them. Channel discovery allows the
                    creation and maintenance of a local
                    view of the network's topology, so that a node can discover routes to desired destinations.
                    Discovery is done using gossip messages, each node that receives gossip messages stores it and
                    routes
                    it on to its peers.
                </p>

                <h3>Lightning Applications</h2>
                    <p>
                        Features that use and build on top of the lightning node and are intended to be used by Stratis
                        master
                        nodes
                    </p>
                    <strong>Atomic Cross-Chain Lighting Swaps</strong>
                    <p>
                        Lightning enables channel rebalancing using atomic swaps between an off-chain lightning channel
                        to a Bitcoin
                        on-chain address (and reverse) using a protocol extension called submarine swaps.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>LBTC to STRAX swaps - </strong>
                        We'll use the submarine swaps protocol to enable atomic swaps between LBTC (Bitcoin locked in
                        lightning channels)
                        to STRAX on the stratis main chain.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>LBTC to LSTRAX swaps - </strong>
                        A lightning protocol extension called HODL invoices introduces expirable hash locked lightning
                        payments, where
                        a routed lightning payment is locked for a certain time until a secret is revealed.
                        Using this mechanism a lightning payment from one chain can be hash locked at the receiver until
                        the lighting
                        swap payment from the sender on the second chain is sent.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Swaps will come with a light weight lightning UI.
                    </p>
                    <strong>Master node swap services</strong>
                    <p>
                        Stratis master nodes can provide a swap matching service where users can register a request to
                        make a swap or ask for
                        available open swaps, effectively becoming a non-custodial market liquidity provider.
                        When a swap will take place it will be routed using the master node channels and will incur
                        routing and swapping fees.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Stratis master nodes are known, semi-trusted, entities however the swap users can stay unknown.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Master nodes that run a swap service will gain fees in BTC and STRAX and will be required to run
                        a fullnode and a lightning
                        node on the Bitcoin and Stratis main chain.
                    </p>
                    <strong>Master node watchtower services</strong>
                    <p>
                        Watchtowers are specialized services that are always online in order to monitor the blockchain
                        for channel breaches
                        on behalf of lightning network participants.
                    <p>
                    </p>
                    Lightning channels create asymmetric commitment transactions on each side of the channel when
                    sending funds off-chain,
                    every new commitment transaction effectively invalidates all previous commitment transactions.
                    A malicious side of the channel who breach the channel can be punished by loosing all the funds in
                    the channel.
                    In order to spot channel breaches node operator must stay online to monitor the blockchain.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The services of monitoring a channel breach can be delegated to master nodes who keep an always
                        online node anyway.
                        A lightning user that is not always online and uses a watchtower service will register an
                        encrypted justice transaction alongside a
                        transaction locator to the Watchtowers. Both the encryption key and the transaction locator are
                        derived from the breach transaction id,
                        meaning that the Watchtower will be able to decrypt the justice transaction only after the
                        corresponding breach is seen on the blockchain.
                    <p>
                    <p>
                        Master nodes that run a Watchtower service can claim fees for such a service either in BTC or
                        STRAX and will be required to run a fullnode
                        and a lightning node of the network they provides watchtower services for.
                    </p>
                    <strong>Master node routing services</strong>
                    <p>
                        Lighting nodes build payment routes in order to make a payment over several hopes.
                        To be able to construct routes a node needs to maintain a recent and correct view of the network
                        channels and balances.
                        This is done using gossip messages that are sent over the lighting network.
                        Nodes stay online and continuously listen to gossip messages to be able to create a graph of the
                        network.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The services of constructing payment routes can be delegated to master who keep an always online
                        node anyway.
                        This enables light wallets that don't need to stay online to make route requests when making a
                        lightning payment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Master nodes that run a routing service can claim fees for such a service either in BTC or STRAX
                        and will be required to run a fullnode
                        and a lightning node of the network they provides routing services for.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Master nodes can also act as lightning nodes that can route trampoline payments.
                        Trampoline payments are a proposed type of payment where the spender routes the payment to an
                        intermediate node who can select the rest
                        of the path to the final receiver.
